This GitHub repository accompanies the manuscript of Cox et al. titled “Observing low-oxygen-adapted phytoplankton in the eastern tropical North Pacific using a Biogeochemical Argo float”. It includes a Jupyter notebook (Notebook_Three_com_model_WMO3901531.ipynb) designed to illustrate how the model, developed in the paper, is fitted to data from a BGC-Argo float in (WMO 3901531) in the eastern tropical North Pacific using Python coding language. This BGC-Argo float file 3901531\_Sprof.nc is available from the BODC data centres (ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo/dac/bodc/) and has been uploaded to this GitHub repository for use in this example.

These data were collected and made freely available by the International Argo Program and the national programs that contribute to it (https://argo.ucsd.edu, https://www.ocean-ops.org). The Argo Program is part of the Global Ocean Observing System.

The notebook can be run through a webpage, just click on the launch-binder image.
